	<h1>I Felt a Funeral in My Brain</h1>
	<h3>By Emily Dickenson</h3>
</div>  

  <body>
    <p>I <strong>felt</strong> a Funeral, in my Brain,</br> 
       <ul>And Mourners to and fro</br> 
           Kept treading - treading - till it seemed</br> 
           That <em>Sense</em> was <strong>breaking</strong> through -</br> 
       </ul></p>   

    <p>And when they all were seated,</br> 
       <ul>A Service, like a Drum - </br> 
           Kept <em>beating</em> - <em>beating</em> - till I thought<br> 
           My mind was going <em>numb</em> -</br> 
        </ul></p>

    <p>And then I heard them <strong>lift</strong> a Box</br> 
       <ul>And <strong>creak</strong> across my Soul</br> 
           With those same Boots of <em>Lead</em>, again,</br> 
           Then <em>Space</em> - began to toll,</br> 
       </ul></p>  
    <p>As all the Heavens were a Bell,</br> 
       <ul>And Being, but an Ear,</br> 
            And I, and <strong>Silence</strong>, some <em>strange</em> Race,</br> 
            Wrecked, solitary, here -</br> 
        </ul></p>

    <p>And then a <strong>Plank</strong> in Reason, broke,</br> 
       <ul>And I <strong>dropped</strong> down, and down -</br> 
           And <strong>hit</strong> a World, at every <em>plunge</em>,</br> 
           And Finished knowing - <em>then</em> -</br> 
       </ul></p>
