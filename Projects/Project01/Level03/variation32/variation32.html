    <p class="p1">I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,</br> 
           And Mourners to and fro</br> 
           Kept treading - treading - till it seemed</br> 
           That Sense was breaking through -</br> 
           </p>   

    <p class="p1">And when they all were seated,</br> 
           A Service, like a Drum - </br> 
           Kept beating - beating - till I thought<br> 
           My mind was going numb -</br> 
          </p>

    <p class="p1" ">And then I heard them lift a Box</br> 
           And creak across my Soul</br> 
           With those same Boots of Lead, again,</br> 
           Then Space - began to toll,</br> 
          </p>  
    <p class="p1">As all the Heavens were a Bell,</br> 
            And Being, but an Ear,</br> 
            And I, and Silence, some strange Race,</br> 
            Wrecked, solitary, here -</br> 
            </p>

    <p class="p1">And then a Plank in Reason, broke,</br> 
           And I dropped down, and down -</br> 
           And hit a World, at every plunge,</br> 
           And Finished knowing - then -</br> 
           </p>
