<h1 id="h1">I <br>Felt <br>a <br>Funeral <br>in <br>My <br>Brain</h1>
<h2 id="h2">Emily <br>Dickenson</h2>

<div class="container1">
	<p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br>
	And Mourners to and fro Kept treading - treading - <br>
	till it seemed That Sense was breaking through - </p>
	<p>And when they all were seated, <br>
	A Service, like a Drum -  Kept beating - beating - <br>
	till I thought My mind was going numb - </p>
	<p>And then I heard them lift a Box  <br>
	And creak across my Soul <br>
	With those same Boots of Lead, again, <br>
	Then Space - began to toll, </p>
</div>

<div class="container2">
	<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br>
	And Being, but an Ear, <br>
	And I, and Silence, some strange Race, <br>
	Wrecked, solitary, here - </p>

	<p>And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br>
	And I dropped down, and down - <br>
	And hit a World, at every plunge, <br>
	And Finished knowing - then - </p>
</div>
