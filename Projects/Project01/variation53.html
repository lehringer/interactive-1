				<p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, And Mourners to and fro  Kept treading - treading - till it seemed That Sense was breaking through - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And when they all were seated, A Service, like a Drum -  Kept beating - beating - till I thought My mind was going numb - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And then I heard them lift a Box And creak across my Soul With those same Boots of Lead, again, Then Space - began to toll, 
				</p>
			
				<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell, And Being, but an Ear, And I, and Silence, some strange Race, Wrecked, solitary, here - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And then a Plank in Reason, broke, And I dropped down, and down - And hit a World, at every plunge, And Finished knowing - then - 
				</p>
