	<p>I felt a<br>
	 Funeral, in <br> 
	my Brain,  And<br>
   Mourners to and<br>
   fro  Kept treading<br>
    treading till<br>
    	it seemed <br>
   		  </p>
   		  <p>
That sense was breaking<br>
 through, And when they <br>
   all were seated, A <br>
  Service, like a Drum,<br> 
 Kept beating beating - <br>
 till I thought  My mind <br>
 was going numb -  And <br>
 			</p>
 			<p>
 then I heard them lift<br> 
 a Box  And creak across<br>
 my Soul  With those same<br> 
 Boots of Lead, again,  Then<br> 
 Space - began to toll,  As<br> 
 all the Heavens were a Bell, <br>
 			</p>
 			<p>
 And Being, &nbsp but an Ear, <br> 
 And I, and &nbsp Silence,<br> 
 some stran&nbspge race, <br> 
 Wrecked, &nbsp solitary,<br> 
 here -  And &nbsp then a<br> 
 		</p><p>
 Plank in &nbsp Reason,<br> 
 broke, And &nbsp I dropped<br> 
 down, and &nbsp down And<br> 
 hit a World, &nbsp at every<br> 
 plunge,  And &nbsp Finished<br> 
 knowing - &nbsp&nbsp then -<br>
