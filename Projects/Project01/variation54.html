			<p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, And Mourners to and fro  Kept<p> <div id="circle-outline">treading</div><div id="circle-outline">treading</div> 
			<p> till it seemed  That Sense was breaking through - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And when they all were seated, A Service, like a Drum -  Kept </p><div id="circle-outline">beating</div>  <div id="circle-outline">beating</div> 
				<p>till I thought My mind was going numb - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And then I heard them lift a Box  And creak across my Soul  With those same</p> <div id="circle-outline">boots</div> of <div id="circle-outline">lead</div> 
				<p>again, Then Space - began to toll,  </p>
			
				<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell,  And Being, but an Ear,  And I, and Silence, some strange Race,  Wrecked, solitary, here - 
				</p>
			
				<p>And then a Plank in Reason, broke,  And I dropped </p>
				<div id="circle-outline">down</div>,
				<p>and</p>
				 <div id="circle-outline">down</div> 
				 <p>-  And hit a World, at every plunge,  And Finished knowing - then - 
				</p>
