<div class="poem">
	<p><span>I</span> felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br>
	And <span>Mourners</span> to and fro Kept treading - treading - <br>
	till it seemed  That Sense <span>was</span> breaking through - </p>
	<p>And when they all <span>were</span> seated, <br>
	A Service, like a Drum -  Kept beating - beating - <br>
	till I thought My mind was going <span>numb</span> - </p>
	<p>And then I heard them lift a Box  <br>
	And <span>creak</span> across my Soul <br>
	With those same Boots of Lead, again, <br>
	Then Space - began to <span>toll,</span> </p>

	<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br>
	And Being, </span>but</p> an Ear, <br>
	And I, and Silence, some strange Race, <br>
	Wrecked, <span>solitary</span>, here - </p>

	<p>And <span>then</span> a Plank in <span>Reason</span>, broke, <br>
	And I <span>dropped</span> down, and <span>down</span> - <br>
	<span>And hit a World, at every plunge, </span><br>
	<span>And Finished knowing</span> - <span>then</span> - </p>
