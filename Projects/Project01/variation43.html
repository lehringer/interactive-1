	<p style="font-size:40pt">I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br>
		And Mourners to and fro Kept treading - treading - <br>
		till it seemed That Sense was breaking through - 
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 30pt">And when they all were seated, <br>
		A Service, like a Drum -  <br>
		Kept beating - beating - till I thought <br>
		My mind was going numb - <br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20pt">And then I heard them lift a Box <br>
		And creak across my Soul <br>
		With those same Boots of Lead, again, <br>
		Then Space - began to toll, <br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 18pt">As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br>
		And Being, but an Ear, <br>
		And I, and Silence, some strange Race, <br>
		Wrecked, solitary, here - 
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 30pt">And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br>
		And I dropped down, and down - <br>
		And hit a World, at every plunge, <br>
		And Finished knowing - then -
